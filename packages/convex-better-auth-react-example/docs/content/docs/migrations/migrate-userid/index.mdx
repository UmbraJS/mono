title: Migrate off of user.userId
description: Migrate away from tracking user.userId in the component user table
---

## tl;dr

The Better Auth component has it's own user table. Your app may have it's own
user table as well. These tables are related via the `userId` field in the
Better Auth user table. The component facilitates this relationship as a special
case, but is going to stop doing that in a future release.

### Why?

Originally the component schema couldn't be configured. This is now possible
through [Local Install](/local-install). Moving forward, keeping two user tables
should be a project decision that is explicitly configured rather than a built
in pattern that often brings confusion.

### Do I need to do anything?

If your app has it's own user table and the `userId` field is populated in any
of your betterAuth user table records, you will need to follow the migration
guide below. Otherwise, you can ignore this guide.

### Keep current behavior

**If avoiding a data migration is the most important thing for you, this is the
way to go.**

If you want to maintain the current approach, you can configure Better Auth to
do that. If you already use Local Install, want to continue keep using two user
tables, and are fine with the app user id being tracked in the component
user table, this will be the simplest approach.

### Track component user id in app table

**If avoiding using Local Install is the most important thing for you, this is
the way to go.**

This is the generally recommended approach for apps that will continue using two
app tables. It doesn't require Local Install. This approach involves migrating
from tracking the app user id in the component to tracking the component user id
in the app user table via an `authId` field.

A data migration is required to backfill the `authId` field.
