# Gandhi Had a Gun

Male loneliness and white Christian replacement. In the West as it currently stands, these are the two demons hiding in our closet which represent the fundamental insecurities of men. And since men are the custodians of violence these impulses become the chaos demons shaping the conflicts between us all. The underlying patterns of these dark impulses, superficially different in flavor but largely the same phenomenon once lead Europe into the most horrendous, depraved, war in world history. A war whose horrors still stalk the nightmares of our generation.

In times of peace we like to believe that nobody is truly bad. That every murderer has a past, every bad leader some twisted logic by which he cast himself as good. But history taught us otherwise: given the right soil, ordinary people aren't driven by misplaced reason or logic to justify atrocities so horrifying they seem beyond imagination. They are driven by something else. Something not dependent on intelligence or any type of internally consistent worldview at all. There exists some deep - narcissistic apathy towards others which allows someone to mentally dance in un-reason and allow themselves to do anything towards anyone. A lack of concern for those that aren't like you. This dark apathy, this enemy of empathy is the definition of true evil. It is proof that evil really does exist. Our neighbors, our countrymen, even our parents are not immune and neither are you, and neither am I. To learn this has been the great curse on our shoulders in this current chapter in our story. And once again, the soil of dark apathy is being tilled. These demons are on the march and have been allowed to walk right into our loved once hearts under the thin vail of loneliness and replacement once more.

## Behold Evil

How do we stop them? How do you fight a chaos demon? Well MLK did it through love. Through dreams of living together which shamed evil men back into the shadows. Gandhi did it with selfless sacrifices - acts to challenge the humanity inside his oppressors hearts which emotionally drained their evil until it could no longer tolerate its own acts. Malcom X, and Muhammed Ali did it through dignity, by setting clear boundaries and standing their ground and the evil men could not deny respect for their bravery. Václav Havel in Czechoslovakia did it by appealing to reason, exposing the absurdities in the Soviet Union, his appeals to reason weakened the system until it collapsed under its own contradictions.

But that only worked because his enemies wanted to appear intelligent. Appealing to reason only works if they care about truth. Love doesn't hold in a heart that's stone. Sacrifice doesn't impress someone who hates empathy. Dignity doesn't move someone who doesn't view you as human.

Friends, do not misunderstand me. These are not failures of love, empathy, or courage. They are proofs that love alone cannot soften a heart made of stone, that empathy cannot reach ears sealed shut, that dignity itself can become an unforgivable offence.

These stories show us the risk of what happens when one side chooses peace while the other chooses domination. On the other side we have the stories of equal heroes who chose violence instead.

Max Manus, a young Norwegian saboteur during the NAZI occupation of Norway. He blew up ships and supply lines, not because he despised life, but because he refused to hand his country’s future to men who despised freedom.

Simo Häyhä, the “White Death” of Finland, picked up his rifle when the Soviet Union invaded his homeland. Alone in the snow, he defended his people. He did not fight to conquer – he fought so his people would not be erased.

The Warsaw Ghetto fighters in 1943 knew they could not win, but they chose to rise rather than walk quietly into extermination. Their courage turned a slaughter into a symbol.

The French Maquis, the partisans in Italy, the resistance cells across occupied Europe – they remind us that sometimes morality is not in turning the other cheek, but in raising the other fist.

Violence in these cases where not betrayal of higher values – it was the last way of defending them. When cooperation is no longer possible, when the other side has already chosen domination, then resistance is not only rational – it is righteous.

## Prisoners Dilemma

This is the prisoner’s dilemma written in blood. And to help clarify how these cases all fit together I think understanding the prisoners dilemma is important. I believe it's the balancing act between resistance in the form of the MLK of love, or of Max Manus with bullets.

The prisoner’s dilemma is a thought experiment in game theory. Imagine two prisoners, each locked in separate rooms, unable to communicate. Under investigation by the police each has a choice: stay silent, or betray the other and defect.

- If both stay silent, they both get light sentences.
- If both defect and betray each other, they both get heavier sentences.
- But if one stays silent while the other defects, the silent one suffers the worst possible fate while the defector walks free.

The paradox is this: In a perfect world we both work together and get the best option. But because each prisoner fears being betrayed, the “rational” strategy is for both to defect. Even though both would be better off cooperating - choosing to be loyal to your partner is the riskiest option when you can't trust your partner would return that loyalty back to you.

Now take that logic out of the prison and put it into history. Gandhi could appeal to his oppressors because they still felt shame. King could dream alongside his enemies because they still wanted to be seen as moral men. Malcolm and Ali could win respect by standing tall, because their opponents still understood courage. In those cases, cooperation was possible, and it worked.

But Jesus was crucified, Sophie Scholl was executed, Romero was gunned down, Bonhoeffer hanged, Korczak deported, Saro-Wiwa executed, Sitting Bull murdered, Biko beaten, Hypatia torn apart. They tried to cooperate, but their opponents chose domination. And just like in the dilemma, when one side cooperates while the other defects, the cooperator suffers the worst fate.

The insight is that for as much as we fear civil war, war is actually not the worst fate - domination is. If the option is war or domination then you should pick war. This is the reality Ukrainians are living right now. It's the reality we lived through during WW2 and it's a reality that's fast approaching us right now.

When love is mocked, empathy trampled, dignity punished, and reason silenced. How do you then respond? How can you move a heart that doesn't work. How do you appeal to morality in someone who hates empathy? How do you reason with someone who doesn't believe in facts. How do you set boundaries with someone who doesn't believe in your rights as a human?

In those moments, the last choice left is resistance. Violence is never the answer they say. But it is! In the end its very often the only answer left. In fact all of civil society depends on a constant underlying threat of violence. And I am not condoning outright violence as an active aggression right now. We must keep condemning it as we have been doing since the start. But I want you to notice how little our condemnation matters to them.

When Breivik killed 70 children in a summer camp hosted by his left wing opponents all of Norway came together. We all condemned the shooter. We spent our time talking about love. About how we can heal. Both the left and the right condemned extreme right wing hate against immigrants. And neither the left or the right wing stopped respecting each other.

When Charlie got shot, a single man, who spent his life condoning the stoning of gay people. Who made light of school shootings - calling them an acceptable consequence of having the second amendment. Who encouraged hatred against immigrants and non-Christians even while Trump was actively rounding them up and sending them to internment camps. A man who offered to post bail for the right wing terrorist that beat Pelosi's husband with a hammer fracturing his skull.

When this man got shot, and nobody knew who the shooter was or what the motives where Trump and all his MAGA dipshits all took to FOX and other media to call for all out civil war against the left.

Meanwhile every single left wing leader condemned it in the strongest terms. Just like they always have done. Just like they did even for the BLM riots, 90% of which was totally peaceful protests, 100% of which was born from legitimate grievances. Still, the lefts leaders where willing to cooperate and actively condemning BLM when they went too far.

But if you ask a MAGA voter about this they either don't know or they lie about it. No amount of trying to be reasonable and kind to the other side matters if the other side doesn't live in reality or doesn't care.

In a world where Breivik, someone who put out a massive right wing manifest and then shot 70 innocent kids is less of a concern of condemnation from your side than the single murder of an active participant in peoples parents being sent to internment camps by a shooter whos' motives are but whispers on the wind then the fact of the matter is that our condemnation is irrelevant. You have lost all humanity. There's no hearth, or reason, or dignity to engage with for cooperation anymore.

The shooting of Charlie was horrible. People should not be shooting each other. The line for that kind of act is not yet crossed. But we are very close, and getting closer. You should be prepared for that line. Because its on the horizon right now. You should be prepared to respond with violence when it stands in front of you. Otherwise you will be annihilated.

To make it perfectly clear yet again - Charlie should not have been shot. But there does come a point where he should. And we are closer to that point than people seem to understand. Between sending immigrants into internment camps, giving himself criminal immunity, sending the national guard into the states of his political opponents, calling for Hillary to be shot, framing Obama as a terrorist, trying to overthrow the government, his supporters calling to hang Mike Pence, Trump calling for full civil war against the left, Trump taking over universities by force and implementing his own leaders there - at some point when the 15th line has been crossed it really is do or die.

When Trump said he would invade Denmark and Canada he crossed a massive line. If Trump actually invades Denmark, as a Norwegian I would consider that a war against all of us. At that point I really do believe that not only could the Nordics morally justify sending out assassination attempts on conservative political leaders in the US but in fact it would be our moral obligation to do so and would be preferable to sending soldiers. Half of the US is still rational. Why should all of them suffer? In such times political assassinations is not just fair but perhaps the kindest option you have. To act passively, and with timid attempts to remain nice would be the opposite of kindness. It would be a betrayal of our values and our dignity and our brothers and sisters.

I want you to understand how serious this is. This is not a game. We are not playing politics. Millions of people have already been setup to die, and millions more are already suffering greatly. We aren't even halfway through the first year of his term. The lies, the deceit, the cruelty has no limit, no reason, no empathy. There's no such thing as unilateral cooperation. We both have to work together or we both have to work against each other.

The lesson is not that love, empathy, or dignity are worthless. The lesson is that they are only effective when the other side is still capable of playing the game of cooperation. When shame, empathy, and respect are gone from the other side - timid kindness from our side does not lead to peace. It leads to complete subjugation.

Or to put it another way, sometimes true kindness requires anger. It required clear boundaries and a willingness to defend those boundaries with real punishments. It requires harsh measures and violence. When your friend is being murdered kindness is not in asking the murderer how their day is, its in shooting the murderer. Be angry. Yell loudly. Make it clear that if push comes to shove bullets can fly both ways.

And so the choice shifts. If both sides defect from each other, both sides suffer - conflict, struggle, war. But that outcome, as terrible as it is, is not the worst one. The worst outcome is when one side insists on peace while the other side insists on domination. Then you dont get war. You get genocide instead. Sometimes war is good. When the question is cruelty, violence really is the answer.

## Listen

I don’t pretend to have a magic solution. The MAGA right and its counterparts must first learn to listen, cool their temperature, and face consequences with honesty – or there will be no outcome but escalation. What I can offer instead is an attempt at listening: to hear what their words and feelings reveal, to understand why so many men feel pushed toward bitterness. I believe modern society itself is to blame. And I believe we can sketch a modest, forward-looking vision of how to organize differently. That is what this article is about.

Across the West, birth rates are collapsing – and two dark movements on the extreme right have rushed to exploit the anxiety. They come in different flavors, but both feed on the same two issues: declining birthrates and the epidemic of male loneliness.

On one side are the religious nationalist men. They follow Trump, Charlie Kirk, Nick Fuentes, and others who promise a return to “traditional families.” Their obsession is white birthrates. They frame women’s empowerment, contraception, divorce, gay marriage, and immigration as part of a conspiracy by shadowy elites to replace them. In their minds, demographic change is a genocide against them, which conveniently justifies their authoritarian agenda: banning rights, persecuting minorities, and tearing down democracy itself.

On the other side is the INCEL subculture. Less ideological, more embittered. These men follow Andrew Tate, Sneako, and their clones. Their values revolve around money, dominance, and sex. They mistake aggression for confidence and treat women as trophies or enemies. Their violence is often personal – harassment, assault, even murder – and their politics amount to subjugating women by force.

Both groups are toxic in different ways, but they surf on two real, legitimate currents of modern life:

1. **Declining birthrates** – not really a crisis of survival, but a crisis of meaning. Family life, once automatic, now feels fragile, uncertain, and increasingly rare.
2. **The loneliness epidemic** – often framed as male-only, but in truth a universal ache. Men may be its loudest sufferers, but women, too, feel the disconnection.

Criticising these men isn’t enough. The only way to counter them is to show that their pain points have real solutions that don’t require hate or authoritarianism. We need a vision of society where family and community flourish in ways that are inclusive, forward-looking, and deeply human.

---

For decades, policymakers have misdiagnosed the problem. The assumption has been that fertility decline is almost a biological reflex — as if improved life expectancy and child survival simply program humans to have fewer kids. That framing makes the decline seem natural and inevitable. On top of that, governments have leaned heavily on subsidies and cash transfers, hoping to make families more affordable. While these measures are good and supportive, Norway’s persistently low birthrate shows they are not decisive. Cost of living is not the primary bottleneck. By circling endlessly around money and biology, we’ve been looking in the wrong place.

The deeper issue isn’t biology or economics. It’s social ecology. Think about where people have always met their partners and closest friends: schools, universities, churches, small towns. These environments work because they guarantee repeated exposure to the same people in low-pressure settings. Over time, strangers become familiar, familiarity becomes rapport, and rapport blossoms into intimacy. Psychologist Barbara Fredrickson calls this process _positivity resonance_ — the idea that connection accumulates through repeated micro-moments of shared warmth, eye contact, or small gestures. Relationships don’t begin with a grand reveal; they grow from these subtle resonances over time.

But look at how modern life is structured.

**1. Bars, apps, and the "all chips on the table" problem.**  
Bars and dating apps demand maximum charisma and vulnerability on the very first encounter. It’s high stakes from the start, which freezes out the cautious or the shy and disproportionately rewards the careless. Real rapport doesn’t grow this way. It grows slowly, over repetition.

**2. Too many strangers, not enough neighbors.**  
In small communities, you meet the same faces again and again. Rapport grows naturally. Cities break this cycle. When you hardly ever see the same person twice, social soil turns barren. Paradoxically, the denser we pack ourselves, the less we actually connect.

**3. The productivity trap.**  
Norway is among the most productive nations on Earth, but productivity has a hidden cost: attention. Work drains not just hours, but emotional energy. When careers and finances occupy every corner of our mental landscape, we’re left with little space to invest in one another. Relationships require downtime, lingering, and play – all the things modern life pushes to the margins. Our culture looks down on "wasting time," but loitering and hanging out are not wastes at all. They are the productive soil in which trust, friendship, and intimacy quietly grow. We should protect and plan for unhurried, repeated contact the way we plan for roads and schools.

**4. The loss of the church.**  
Religion once provided a social operating system. Weekly rituals, cross-generational contact, and predictable gatherings allowed bonds to form effortlessly. We rightly stepped away from dogma, but failed to replace the social infrastructure that made community life possible. Without a secular equivalent, we drift in isolation.

---

This, more than any economic or biological factor, is why Norway struggles to grow its population and why so many feel lonely. We don’t lack money, or security, or even desire for connection. We lack the environments that make connection likely.

If Norway wants to reverse both its fertility decline and its loneliness epidemic, it should stop thinking only in terms of subsidies and start thinking in terms of _social architecture_. What if our cities were designed so you actually bumped into the same people each week? What if every neighborhood had a secular “parish hall” where locals could gather without pretense or paywalls? What if we treated warm, casual social contact as a form of infrastructure – as essential as roads or broadband?

Norway has the chance to pioneer a new model: a forward-looking society that doesn’t just optimize for wealth, but for the texture of everyday human contact. Imagine becoming the global beacon for how modern people can still find one another – not just on apps or in fleeting transactions, but through the quiet, repeated, trust-building encounters that have always been the seedbed of families.

Our fertility and loneliness problems aren’t mysteries of biology. They’re the predictable result of stripping away the spaces and rhythms that once let strangers become neighbors, partners, and parents. If we want more Norwegians – and happier Norwegians – we first need more ways for Norwegians to meet, linger, and meet again.
